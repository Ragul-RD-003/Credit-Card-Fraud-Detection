Overview

This project builds a classification model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset used is anonymized and consists of transaction features including time, amount, and anonymized input variables (V1-V28). It is loaded from ai_powered_credit_guard_data.csv.
